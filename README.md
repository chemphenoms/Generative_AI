# Generative_AI
This repository contains my implementations of the tutorials from the Generative AI courses link in the bracket (https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118, https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/, https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/generative-ai-courses-guide/)
by Deeplearning.ai and Google.

It includes hands-on projects from various short courses covering various topics in GenAI like LLMs, building a chatbot, prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and real-world generative AI applications.
